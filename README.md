# siroca-bakery-recipe
This web app will enhance the use of your home bakery made by Siroca inc.  
Ingredients data is based on the product manual of SHB-712 and SHB-722.  
https://www.siroca.co.jp/product/bakery/  
  
I made this to learn vue.js and to keep my product manual from getting covered in bread flour.  
This repository is **NOT** affiliated with Siroca inc. 
  
**This is a work in progress.**
